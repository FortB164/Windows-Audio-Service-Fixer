# WASFixer - Windows Audio Services Fixer

A lightweight, professional Windows service that actively prevents the Windows Audio service from being stopped or disabled. Built with native WinAPI for maximum efficiency and minimal resource usage.

## üéØ Purpose

WASFixer solves the common problem where the Windows Audio service (`Audiosrv`) gets stopped randomly or accidentally by other applications, causing audio to stop working. The service continuously monitors the audio service and immediately restarts it if it detects any stop attempts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**Windows Only**: This software is designed specifically for Windows operating systems (10/11) and will not work on macOS, Linux, or other operating systems. The service uses Windows-specific APIs and registry functions that are not available on other platforms.

**Administrator Rights Required**: The service requires Administrator privileges to function properly, as it needs to control Windows system services.

## üì¶ Installation

### **Automatic Installation**
1. Download and run `WASFixerSetup.exe`
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Service starts automatically after installation

## üóëÔ∏è **Uninstallation**
### **Automatic Uninstallion:**
1. Navigate to: `C:\Program Files\Windows Audio Services Fixer\`
2. Run `unins000.exe` (or similar uninstaller executable)
3. Follow the uninstallation wizard

### **Manual Cleanup (if needed):**
1. Stop the `WASFixer.exe` process in Task Manager
2. Delete the installation folder: `C:\Program Files\Windows Audio Services Fixer\`
3. Delete the log folder: `C:\ProgramData\AudioFix\`

## üöÄ Usage

3. **If already stopped**: Log as critical and restart
4. **State tracking**: Monitor transitions for detailed logging

## üìä Performance Metrics

### **Resource Usage**
- **Memory**: ~5MB RAM (idle)
- **CPU**: <0.1% (normal operation)
- **Disk I/O**: Minimal (log rotation only)
- **Network**: None

### **Response Times**
- **Detection**: <1 second
- **Restart**: <2 seconds
- **Logging**: Immediate with file flush

## üìù Logging

### **Log Location**
```
C:\ProgramData\WASFixer\WASFixer.log
```

### **Log Format**
```
[2024-01-15 14:30:25] Service started
[2024-01-15 14:30:26] Service is running normally
[2024-01-15 14:35:12] WARNING: Service is being stopped! Attempting to prevent shutdown
[2024-01-15 14:35:13] Service started successfully
```

### **Log Rotation**
- **Max size**: 10KB
- **Backup**: `WASFixer.log.bak`
- **Encoding**: UTF-16 LE with BOM
- **Flushing**: Immediate disk writes

### **Verification**
1. Check Task Manager for `WASFixer.exe` process
2. Monitor log file for activity
3. Test by attempting to stop Windows Audio service

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Service won't start:**
- Ensure running as Administrator
- Check Windows Event Log for errors
- Verify `Audiosrv` service exists

**Log file not created:**
- Check `C:\ProgramData\WASFixer\` permissions
- Ensure Administrator privileges
- Verify disk space

**Audio still stops:**
- Check log file for error messages
- Verify service is actually running
- Test with manual service stop

### **Debug Information**
- **Log file**: `C:\ProgramData\AudioFix\audioFix.log`
- **Process**: Check Task Manager for `WASFixer.exe`
- **Registry**: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

### **Permissions Required**
- **Administrator**: For service control operations
- **File system**: Write access to `C:\ProgramData\`
- **Registry**: Read/write access for startup integration

### **Safety Features**
- **Read-only service queries**: No modification of other services
- **Minimal privileges**: Only what's necessary for audio service control
